              <p class="text">
                The Meta Side Table is one of our signature pieces and well
                suited to all communal living spaces and bedrooms. Consisting of
                a series of arranged, powder coated rectangular and circular
                shapes, Meta’s appearance changes from delicate and thin, to
                substantial and full depending on the viewing angle. Featuring
                multi-directional storage for your reading material and an even
                top for decorative accessories.

              <p class="text">
                Click is a boltless shelving system. The minimalistic form and
                construction, as well as the visual lightness, form the
                aesthetic characteristics of the shelf. Constructed of 1.5mm
                thin sheet steel, a girder and shelves, the system functions
                similar to a construction kit. Only four screws fix the girder
                together to which the shelves are simply hung up without any
                tools. The material and precision of the components guarantee
                the stability and assembly.

              <p class="text">
                Designed as a versatile storage option, the Float Shelf is open
                to diverse interpretations – holding a book as a bedside or side
                table, bearing weight as wall console, storing a magazine
                collection, serving as a compact standing desk, or safeguarding
                small personal essentials as a hallway tray. The Float Shelf
                equally adds a touch of character to hotel rooms, boutique
                accommodation and boardinghouses. Embodying purity at its most
                elegant degree, the strict geometry of this wall-mounted shelf
                lends its form a sculptural appeal. The Float Shelf consists of
                two offset levels cut from a single sheet of aluminum, with a
                simple two-fold composition allowing for flexible placement, use
                and display. Referencing the reduced aesthetic principles of
                modernism in the Bauhaus tradition, its design distils the
                essence of a shelf.
